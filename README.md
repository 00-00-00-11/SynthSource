### ...and so much more? Well, you've come to the right place!

***

https://www.synthsourceapp.com/ is a site I developed for the repl.it hackathon. Before you get started, **definitely watch the 5-minute demonstration video:**

#### https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AdaGIsv6jL0

**It is STRONGLY RECOMMENDED that you browse the site in a wide Chrome window.**

To list a few of the features here, you can:

- Create music using piano, organ, guitar, drum & cymbal noises (+ more!)
- Practice your singing and whistling, (and even use it to control the player in one of the games!)
- Discover new music by simply clicking locations on a map!
- Find *personalized* recommendations based on your current interests
- Explore pieces created by other users!
- And much, much more.

I can't list it all, so what are you waiting for? Watch the video, visit https://www.synthsourceapp.com/ today, and let me know what you think!

# The Details

I created this site completely on my own, on repl.it, over the past few weeks. It was an extremely rewarding experience, and I learned a lot about the power of repl.it ðŸ’ª, the importance of good design âœ¨, and best practice when working with APIs ðŸ’».

In case you're wondering, I haven't slept much since June!

*This entire project was developed on repl.it starting around July 5th!*

- Early development: https://repl.it/@samdevz/SynthSource
- Testing fork: https://repl.it/@samdevz/SynthSource-1
- Final version: https://repl.it/@samdevz/SynthSource-Final

While working on the project, I even [found a bug](https://repl.it/bugs/p/django-repls-arent-installing-packages-correctly) and was able to report it to repl.it's team. Cool!

- jQuery
- Django
- Genius API
- Spotify API
- YouTube API
